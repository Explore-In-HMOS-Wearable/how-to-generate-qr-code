# Use Cases

The QR Code Generator is designed to help developers and users explore different ways of generating QR codes on
HarmonyOS NEXT devices. It provides practical scenarios where QR code creation can be seamlessly integrated into daily
use and application development:

1. Instant QR Code Generation: Quickly create QR codes within the app using the built-in QRCode component for simple
   sharing or testing.
2. Enhanced QR Management with Scan Kit: Leverage HarmonyOS Scan Kit to generate more advanced QR codes with extended
   customization and reliability.
3. Learning and Prototyping: Developers can use the app as a hands-on reference for implementing QR code features in
   their own projects.
4. Wearable and Mobile Compatibility: Demonstrates how QR code generation works efficiently on both wearable devices and
   mobile HarmonyOS NEXT applications.
5. Practical Everyday Scenarios: Supports use cases like sharing contact information, generating payment codes, linking
   to websites, or providing quick access to app features.
